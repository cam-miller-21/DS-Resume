## Related Experience
__BYU Idaho Data Science President__, Jan 2021 – Apr 2021

- My purpose was to manage the project managers, making sure that they would be making progress in providing deliverables of what the clients wanted.

- The tools used were zoom, slack, & google docs in coordinating and presenting projects

- The benefits and results that I gained as being President have been able to delegate responsibilities, see society grow and find more students that want build their skills in Data Science. It’s also been able to give me more perspective of what it takes to run a successful society and how to maintain it.

## RBDC Consultant | BYU-Idaho
`April 2020 – March 2021`

__Madison County Fire Department Analyst__

- The tools used were R and Shiny 

- What we were able to deliver was an interactive map with all of the roads and fire hydrants in Madison County and create an algorithm to click anywhere on the map of where a potential fire could be or be able to type in an address, and calculate the distance in miles to the fire and how many gallons of water they can deliver.


## Straight Line Yard Care
`Jan 2020 – Apr 2020 `

__Straight Line Yard Care Consultant | Business Analyst__
- With this company there are a lot of vehicles to account for and having to know when each vehicle needs maintenance can be time consuming, so being able to type in the odometer reading and have it say if maintenance needs to be done could make things go more smoothly.

- The tool used was excel

- I was able to make a spreadsheet with a drop down list of the vehicles he owned and be able to choose one of them and have it say if the vehicle needed maintenance done or not.

## Progrexion
`Dec 2018 – Mar 2020`

__Sales Associate__

- Made calls expressing that we are a credit repair service, and helped them understand they would need our services.

- A benefit to working here was developing client relationships and getting them to open up about what they wanted to do with their credit while also learning about what would be holding them back from achieving their goals, and telling them how we could help.
